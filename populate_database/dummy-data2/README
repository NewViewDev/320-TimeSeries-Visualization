Generators and cleared supply data
====================================


    dummy-node-data2.csv

    Adds a new column MW, which contains the power supplied
    at that pnode by a generator.  If the column is empty,
    there was no power supplied.


    dummy-generators.csv

    A list of generators and their attributes.  You connect 
    a generator to the node data via it's pnode attribute.

With this new data, you now have two measures to use in both
use cases: LMP and MW.

In addition, you have new set of generator attributes you can
use to create the summary statistics.  For example, you can 
compute the average LMP, by generator fuel type, for 2 pm 
US/Eastern.  Or average power supplied, grouped by load zone i
for the entire data set.
